# Go to Brownlow in 3 weeks

## Building a predictive model for the 2022 Brownlow medal

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for the 2022 Brownlow medal, starting from scratch, in 3 weeks. This will be a first for me, I've never attempted anything like this and so I'll be trying to record my process along the way, good and bad, and see how I go on the 19th of September. My understanding of football, and what the drivers for Brownlow votes, is very basic so I'll be learning as I go. I'll be using the [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/books/) package to develop the predictive model.
